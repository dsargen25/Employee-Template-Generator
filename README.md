  ## Description:
  A team generator command-line application. Prompts the user to input an unlimited number of team-members that are a mixture of engineers, interns, and managers. After the user finishes the list of members, the details will be output to an html page displaying said team members with basic info.

  ## Installation:
  After cloning or unzipping the repo, run the "develop" directory in a bash terminal with node.js installed. Type "npm i" to install packages from the package.json (which includes inquirer.) After typing and entering "node app.js" the user can start using the cli application.

  ## Usage:
  Navigate the inquirer prompts with the respective commands issued to you. Once you hit "No" for adding another member, navigate to the output folder to find your completed html page.
